## Background

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1zpGTXPle.png)

The design and optimization of enzymes for specific functions have always been a critical aspect of biotechnology. Traditional methods for enzyme engineering are often labor-intensive, requiring iterative rounds of mutation, expression, and screening. In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational biology has revolutionized this process, allowing for the in silico prediction of enzyme structures, stability, and functionality. By combining cutting-edge AI models, molecular modeling tools, and computational docking, this software provides an automated platform for novel enzyme sequence generation and efficiency analysis.
